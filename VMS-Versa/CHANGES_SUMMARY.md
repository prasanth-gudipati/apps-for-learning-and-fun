# VMS Debug Tool - UI Improvements Summary

## âœ… Changes Implemented:

### a) **Moved "Logs section" before tenants section**
- **Before**: Order was Operations â†’ Tenant Selection â†’ Redis Keys â†’ ConfigMaps â†’ Logs
- **After**: Order is now Operations â†’ System Logs â†’ Tenant Selection (with Redis/ConfigMaps inside)
- **Behavior**: Logs section now appears immediately when connected, before tenant data is built

### b) **Moved Config-map and Redis-keys Options inside the tenant card**
- **Before**: Redis Keys and ConfigMaps were separate sections in the left panel
- **After**: Both options are now embedded within the "Tenant Selection" section
- **UI Changes**:
  - Added "Tenant Data Options" sub-section inside tenant card
  - Redis Keys and ConfigMaps are now visually grouped with distinct styling
  - Both sections appear only when a tenant is selected
  - Buttons are arranged side-by-side for better space utilization

### c) **Fixed Redis-keys and Config-map selection issues**
- **Problem**: Dropdown selections weren't working after the UI restructure
- **Fix**: Updated JavaScript event handlers to use the new DOM structure:
  - Updated `selectTenant()` function to show/hide `tenant-options` div
  - Fixed references to the moved Redis and ConfigMap elements
  - Updated connection status handlers to properly manage section visibility
  - Fixed disconnect cleanup to hide tenant options

## ðŸŽ¯ **New UI Flow:**

1. **On Connection**: 
   - Operations section appears immediately
   - **System Logs section appears immediately** (NEW)
   - Tenant section remains hidden until data is built

2. **After Tenant Data Built**:
   - Tenant Selection section appears
   - Operations buttons become enabled
   - Log viewing becomes enabled

3. **When Tenant Selected**:
   - **Tenant Data Options section appears within the tenant card** (NEW)
   - Redis Keys section shows with loading state
   - ConfigMaps section shows with loading state
   - Both sections populate with data specific to selected tenant

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Changes:**

### HTML Structure Updates:
```html
<!-- NEW STRUCTURE -->
<div class="section" id="operations-section">...</div>
<div class="section" id="logs-section">...</div>  <!-- MOVED UP -->
<div class="section" id="tenant-section">
    <!-- Existing tenant selection -->
    <div id="tenant-options">  <!-- NEW CONTAINER -->
        <!-- Redis Keys (MOVED HERE) -->
        <!-- ConfigMaps (MOVED HERE) -->
    </div>
</div>
```

### JavaScript Updates:
- `selectTenant()`: Now shows/hides `tenant-options` instead of separate sections
- `connection_status` handler: Shows logs section immediately on connection
- `tenant_database_updated` handler: Only shows tenant section after data is built
- Disconnect cleanup: Properly hides tenant options

4. **Select Tenant**: 
   - **Redis Keys and ConfigMaps options appear inside tenant card**
   - Both dropdowns should populate with data
   - **Selections should now work properly**
